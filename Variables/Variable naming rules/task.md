## Variable naming rules
Speaking of variable names, we can distinguish between restrictions and rules.

- Restrictions (JavaScript limitations):
  - The name must contain only letters, digits, or the symbols $ and _
  - The first character must not be a digit.
  - Must NOT match the JavaScript reserved names: let, var, ... full list [here](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Lexical_grammar#keywords)
- Rules (Programmer arrangements)
  - When the name contains multiple words, use [camelCase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camel_case) for naming: `complexVariableName`.
  - Try to choose meaningful variable names. It is hard to guess what is in a box with the `EOq3I_S499$` sticker, right? ðŸ™‚

Examples of JavaScript valid variable names:
- `text`
- `totalAmount`
- `$`, `_` â€“ yes, a variable name can consist of a single character, even if it is a `$` or `_` character
- `EOq3I_S499$`

### Task
