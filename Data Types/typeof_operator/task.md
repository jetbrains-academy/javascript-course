The `typeof` operator in JavaScript is used to determine the type of a given variable or expression. It returns a string indicating the type of the operand.

```javascript
// Example: Using typeof with different types
let number = 42;
console.log(typeof number); // "number"

let string = "Hello, world!";
console.log(typeof string); // "string"

let boolean = true;
console.log(typeof boolean); // "boolean"
```

Type Checking: Helps determine the type of a variable, which is useful for debugging and validation.
Dynamic Typing: Useful in dynamically typed languages like JavaScript to ensure variables are of expected types.
