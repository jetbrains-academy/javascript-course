# Dynamic and Weak Typing

### Dynamic Typing
JavaScript is dynamically typed, meaning that variables do not have a fixed type. The type of a variable is determined at runtime based on the value assigned to it. This allows for greater flexibility, as the same variable can hold different types of values at different times.


```javascript
// Example 1: Dynamic Typing
let variable = 42; // variable is a number
console.log(typeof variable); // "number"

variable = "Hello, world!"; // variable is now a string
console.log(typeof variable); // "string"
```
<div class="hint" title="Advantages of Dynamic Typing">
1. <b>Flexibility</b>: Variables can hold values of any type, which allows for more flexible and reusable code.
2. <b>Ease of Use</b>: Less boilerplate code is required since you don't need to declare variable types explicitly.
3. <b>Rapid Prototyping</b>: Faster development and prototyping as you can quickly change variable types without modifying the code structure.
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Disadvantages of Dynamic Typing">
<ul>
<li><b>Runtime Errors</b>: Type-related errors are only caught at runtime, which can lead to bugs that are harder to detect and fix.</li>
<li><b>Performance</b>: Dynamic typing can lead to slower performance due to the overhead of type checking and conversion at runtime.</li>
<li><b>Readability</b>: Code can become harder to read and understand, as the type of a variable is not always clear from the context.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Weak Typing
JavJavaScript is weakly typed, which means that it allows implicit type conversions between different types. This can lead to unexpected behavior if not carefully managed. For example, adding a number and a string will result in string concatenation rather than arithmetic addition.


```javascript
let x = 5;
let y = "10";
let result = x + y; // result is "510" because y is a string
console.log(result);

let a = "5";
let b = 10;
let sum = Number(a) + b; // sum is 15 because a is converted to a number
console.log(sum);
```
<div class="hint" title="Advantages of Weak Typing">
<ul>
<li><b>Convenience</b>: Implicit type conversions can make code more concise and easier to write, especially for simple operations.</li>
<li><b>Interoperability</b>: Easier to work with different types of data without needing explicit conversions, which can be useful in web development.</li>
</ul>
</div>

<div class="hint" title="Disadvantages of Weak Typing">
<ul>
<li><b>Unexpected Behavior</b>: Implicit type conversions can lead to unexpected results and bugs that are difficult to trace.</li>
<li><b>Debugging Difficulty</b>: Debugging can be more challenging because type-related issues may not be immediately obvious.</li>
<li><b>Maintainability</b>: Code can become less maintainable over time as implicit conversions may introduce subtle bugs that are hard to fix.</li>
</ul>
</div>

### Task
Declare a variable `result` and assign it the value of the sum of the string `"10"` and the number `5`. Print the result to the console.

\Remember that adding a string and a number in JavaScript results in string concatenation. Ensure you understand the difference between implicit and explicit type conversion.
