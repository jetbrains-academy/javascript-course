In arithmetic, the plus operator means adding numbers. 
But you may have noticed that intuitively it often denotes union. 
For example, if you see `Lemonade+Ice` on a restaurant menu, you will immediately understand what is meant and will not think about math lessons.

There is similar logic in the JavaScript language. For example, the `+` operator can be used to _concatenate_ strings:


```javascript
let s = "Hello" + "World"
console.log(s)  // HelloWorld
```

If the addition operator has only one element of type `string`, the second element will be converted to type string. Since the strings are concatenated as is, you have to remember to add spaces where you want them.
```javascript
console.log(1 + ' January')  // 1 January
console.log('January ' + 1)  // January 1
```

The plus operator is the only binary arithmetic operator that does this. The others will, on the contrary, convert arguments to numbers
```javascript
console.log("1" - true)  // converts "true" to 1
console.log("10" / "2")  // converts both operands to integers
console.log(10 * "2")  // converts "2" to integer
```

Sometimes, if we need to convert a non-number to a number, the unary plus operator comes to the rescue. If the operand is already a number, no other conversions will take place:
```javascript
console.log(+false)  // converts false to 0
console.log(+"-10")  // converts to integer
console.log(+10)     // leaves integer without any conversions
```

### Task
You are given a `student` object.
Using the values of its fields and the string concatenation operator, write a string with the following format to the signature variable:
```
"<name>, <age> years old, <university> University"
```
Where instead of `<name>`, `<age>` and `<university>` you should use the values of the `name`, `age` and `university` fields of the `student` object, respectively.
