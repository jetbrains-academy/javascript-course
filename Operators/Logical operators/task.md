There are several logical operators in the JavaScript language. 
Despite their name, they can work not only with the _boolean_ data type, but for simplicity we'll start with it.

### OR
In JS this operator is represented with two vertical lines: `||`  
The idea of _OR_ operation is that result will be `true` if **at least one** of the operands is `true`:
```javascript
console.log(false || false)  // false
console.log(false || true)   // true
console.log(true || false)   // true
console.log(true || true)    // true
```

### AND
In JS this operator is represented with two ampersands: `&&`  
The idea of _AND_ operation is that result will be `true` only if **both** of the operands are `true`:
```javascript
console.log(false && false)  // false
console.log(false && true)   // false
console.log(true && false)   // false
console.log(true && true)    // true
```

### NOT
_NOT_ is a unary operator and it’s represented with one exclamation sign `!`  
Its logic is simple: it inverts a value from `false` to `true` and vice versa:
```javascript
console.log(!false)  // true
console.log(!true)   // false
```

### Using with variables
Of course, you can use these operators with variables:
```javascript
let a = false
let b = true
let c =  a || !b  // "c" variable will be "false"
```
<div class="hint">
Since the <code>!</code> operator has higher precedence than the <code>||</code> operator, it will be executed first and no brackets are required.
</div>

and [NOT](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Logical_NOT) in the official docs.

### Task
You are given a piece of a program that should check if an employee's pass allows access to the warehouse.  
Access to the warehouse is granted only if all 3 conditions are met at the same time:
- Pass has warehouse access enabled
- It’s not a guest pass
- Pass is not blocked
