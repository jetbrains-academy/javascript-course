You know about _comparison_ operators from school math. 
In JS, we have the following _comparison_ operators. Result of them is always of type _boolean_.
```
>  -- greater than
<  -- less than
>= -- greater than or equals
<= -- less than or equals
== -- equals
!= -- not equals
```

For example:
```javascript
console.log(10 <= 20);  // true
console.log(10 == 20);  // false
console.log(10 != 20);  // true
```

### Comparing strings
You can also compare strings, not only numbers. They are compared _lexicographically_. The idea of this approach is as follows:
1. The first two characters of the strings are compared. If they are **not** equal, then the result of comparing the strings is the result of comparing these **characters**
2. If they are **equal**, then the next two characters are compared (go to step 1)
3. If one of the strings in this character-by-character comparison ends earlier, it is considered "less"
4. If the strings are **equal** in length and **all characters match**, then the strings are **equal**.

But how are the characters compared? They are compared according to their order in the alphabet. Earlier means less.

What about _uppercase_ characters? Any _uppercase_ character is said to be _less_ than any _lowercase_ character
```javascript
console.log('Z' < 'a');               // true
console.log('Abra' < 'Abracadabra');  // true
console.log('Abadef' < 'Abc');        // true
```

### Comparing different types
If you try to compare different data types, JavaScript will try to convert them to numbers:
```javascript
console.log('20' > 9);   // true, string '20' will be converted to number 20
console.log(true == 1);  // true
```

### Task
You are given a program with blanks. 
Fill in the blanks to check if the value falls within the specified range.

<div class="hint">
  When solving this task, it will be needed to use both <i>comparison</i> operators and the <i>logical</i> operator.
