In programming, incrementing or decrementing a variable by one is a very commonly used operation. 
So much so that there are dedicated operations for that:  
- `++` for _increment_ 
- `--` for _decrement_


The challenge for beginners is that these operations can be used in both _prefix_ and _postfix_ forms. Let's clarify with examples:

```javascript
let sum = 10
sum++
console.log(sum);  // 11
++sum
console.log(sum);  // 12
```

So far, there seems to be no difference, until we try to assign the result of this operation.

```javascript
let temp  // declare one more variable

sum = 10
temp = sum++
console.log(sum);   // 11
console.log(temp);  // 10

sum = 10
temp = ++sum
console.log(sum);   // 11
console.log(temp);  // 11
```

Now we can see the difference:
The _prefix_ form returns the already incremented value as the operator's result, while the _postfix_ form returns the old value before the increment operation was performed.

The decrement operator works in exactly the same way.

### Task
Place an increment or decrement instead of `???` in such a way that after the program execution, the values of the variables will be:
- `a`: `11`
- `b`: `9`
- `c`: `9`
