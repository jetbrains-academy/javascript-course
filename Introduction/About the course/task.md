**Introduction to JavaScript** course designed for individuals with little to no programming experience
who want to learn JavaScript from the ground up.

You'll start with fundamental concepts such as variables, conditions, and loops, 
then gradually progress to more complex and practical topics, including data structures, 
error handling, and asynchronous functions. 

The course is structured into small, manageable steps, each combining 
a brief theoretical explanation with a hands-on task to reinforce learning.

By the end of the course, youâ€™ll have a strong foundation to explore advanced JavaScript frameworks and pursue professional web application development.

Have fun, and good luck!
